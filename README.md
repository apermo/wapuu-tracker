[![License: GPL v2+](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv2+-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

GitHub template repository for bootstrapping WordPress plugins and themes. Ships both plugin and theme scaffolding; a `setup.sh` script lets developers choose their mode and configures the project accordingly.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- WordPress 6.4+ (required by `wp_admin_notice()`)
- Composer
- Node.js 20+ and npm (activates husky pre-commit hook, runs Playwright)
- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/) (for local development)

## Installation

1. [Create a new repository from this template](https://github.com/apermo/template-wordpress/generate)
2. Clone your new repository
3. Run the setup script:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

The script prompts for:
- **Slug** (kebab-case, e.g. `my-plugin`)
- **Namespace** (e.g. `Apermo\MyPlugin`)
- **Composer package name**
- **Mode** (`plugin` or `theme`)

It replaces all placeholders, removes irrelevant mode files, configures DDEV, and optionally sets up GitHub labels and branch protection.

## Development

```bash
composer install
npm install              # Activates husky hook + installs Playwright
composer cs              # Run PHPCS
composer cs:fix          # Fix PHPCS violations
composer analyse         # Run PHPStan
composer test            # Run all tests
composer test:unit       # Run unit tests only
composer test:integration # Run integration tests only
npm run test:e2e         # Run Playwright E2E tests (incl. WCAG 2.1 AA a11y checks)
```

### Local WordPress Environment

```bash
ddev start && ddev orchestrate
```

Uses [ddev-orchestrate](https://github.com/apermo/ddev-orchestrate) to download WordPress, create `wp-config.php`, install, and activate the plugin/theme.

### Git Hooks

The pre-commit hook (PHPCS + PHPStan) is managed by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
and activates automatically after `npm install`. A `commit-msg` hook also
validates the conventional-commit format locally so invalid messages are
rejected at `git commit` time, matching the `pr-validation` CI workflow.
No manual configuration required.

## Template Sync

To pull upstream template changes into a derived project:

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/apermo/template-wordpress.git
git fetch template
git checkout -b chore/sync-template
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
